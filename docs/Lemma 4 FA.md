$T: \mathbb{R}^n\to E$ normed space
1. $T$ is linear, hence $T$ is continuous
2. $T$ is linear bijective, then $T,T^{-1}$ are continuous 
3. $E$ is a normed space with $\dim (E)<\infty$ and $T: E\to F$ linear, $F$ is normed space, then $T$ is continuous
4. $\dim (E)<\infty$ then all the norms are equivalent
